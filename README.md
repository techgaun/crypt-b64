> Simple tool to decode &amp; encode crypt based base64 encoded text to standard base64 encoding

Crypt's encoding uses `./0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz` as the charset
and base64 encoding (as we know & use a lot) uses `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/` as the charset.

This tool helps decode & also re-encode crypt based data to base64 encoding
